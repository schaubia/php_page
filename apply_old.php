    Apply
</h1>

<p>
*IMPORTANT* If you plan to participate the conference, you are advised 
to apply as soon as possible and book your accommodation early because 
of peak tourist season! 
Additionally, due to the limited capacity of the HdA Auditorium (maximum of 100 people) 
the registration is "first-come-first-serve".
General participation without an abstract is possible, but please keep in mind that
applications with an abstract for either a poster or a talk will be considered with a priority.
</p>

<p>
A registration will be considered complete once the conference fee of 200 Euro is <a href="payment.php">paid</a> .
